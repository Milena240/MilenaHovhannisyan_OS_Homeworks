In this example we can see a difference between the sizes of structd.
In the first example, compiler does its work as it alwasy do, it adds paddings between varibles so cpu can read them efficiently. And the size is 16, as it add 3 pad after char, so 1(char) + 3(pad) + 4(int) + 8(double) = 16
THe second example, when we use #pragma pack(1) compiler disables alignment padding and packs all members on 1-byte boundaries. So the size of the struct calculates as, 1(char) + 4(int) + 8(double) = 13
And also we can see the variable references in the memory.
