As we can see each type has a specific size of bytes which they need to be allocated in the 
memory. int - 4, char - 1, double 8, short 2. One thing that we can notice is that each type 
address is divisable by the bytes they have. 
And even though the variables are declared sequentially, the compiler may reorder or inster paddings between then, to make sure that CPU can access the data efficiently.
